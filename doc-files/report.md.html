Using last week's Ray Tracing algorithm, the ray tracer was able to render Sponza at 640x400 resolution with Direct Illumination in 55.7 minutes. Our Path Tracer was able to perform this same feat in about a quarter of a second. This is exponentially faster, and shows the benefits of Monte Carlo Algorithms to approximate pixel values.

Quality Demonstration
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![The G3D San Miguel from the Balcony Camera's Perspective. The rendered used 500 paths with 6 scattering events at 1280 x 720 resolution and completed in 1.12 hours](quality2.png border=1)

This shows our program running on a complex scene with many paths and 6 scattering events will produce a high quality image.

Questions
================================
1. It takes four scattering events to produce a caustic. The first event is the light hitting the outside of a transparent material and refracting. The second event is the light "exiting" the material (hitting the other side) and refracting again. The third event is the light hitting a surface. The fourth event is the light hitting the camera.
2. The rays project ran at $\O(n*p^{d}*L)$, where n is the number of pixels, p is the number of primary rays per pixel, d is the maximum path depth, and L is the number of lights in teh scene. We can derive this from our tests, where we found that the time is linear with respect to the number of lights, number of pixels, and number of primary rays. We never went deeper than a path depth of 2, but we know that each primary ray produces p scattering rays at each level d, so ultimately we end up with $p^{d}$ scattered rays.
3. Using the same definition above, we derive that our Path tracer ran at $O(n*p*d*L)$. This is proven by our graphs, which show that this program is definitely linear with respect to the scattering depth and the number of paths. This program is therefore exponentially times faster with respect to the maximum path (scattering) depth d.
4.  Use the uniform random number generator to generate a random number n between 0 and 100. Then multiply that number by 50.5.  This will give n a value between 0 and 5050, which is the sum of all the numbers from 0 to 100.  Then, make a counter i starting at 1 incrementing once per loop and subtract i from n.  If that subtraction makes n negative, then return i.  This is very similar to the light importance sampling from the lab. Below is code for it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
def proportionalRNG(uniformRNG):
        n = uniformRNG(0, 100) * 50.5;
        for(i = 1; i <= 100; ++i):
            n -= i
            if(n < 0):
                return i
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 5. The point of the Path Tracing Algorithm used in this project is that we are able to sample a limit of the rendering algorithm with a high probability that our sample will produce a result similar to the true solution (what the rendering algorithm would produce). So, if we change the algorithm we are using, such that all of the samples were infinite, then, we would just be performing the rendering algorithm. 

Self-Review
================================
Below we will provide a short analysis of how we feel we did on this project.

Code Design
---------------------------------
Our code is structured in a logical ordering that is efficient and chronological, making it easy to follow the logic behind it.

Code Readability
----------------------------------
We spent a lot of time making sure that our code was readable by using specific variable names and breaking the problem into a series of small helper functions that each have a specific job.

Expected Code Correctness
-----------------------------------
There are small bugs in our code that result in impecfect pictures, but we are pleased by the overall image results and speed of our program, which meets all of the specifications of the project.

Report Writing and Presentation Quality
------------------------------------
The report is presented following the specification provided in a neat and orderly fashion.

Expected Report Correctness
-----------------------------------
To the best of our knowledge, we believe we answered all of the questions correctly and provided evidence for our program's correctness.

Workflow as Documented in Journal
--------------------------------------
Admittedly, this is our weakest area, because we did not update it every time we made changes, but we feel we were only stuck on a few issues that we did document in our journal.

Overall Expected Grade
----------------------------------------
We believe we deserve an A on this project based on our program's correctness and our report.

Skills
================================

The following is a summary of what we learned in this project.

Software Engineering:
    - We learned to always check what we are passing to each function when we have a bug
    - We learned to never use integer division
    - We learned more of the helpful features implemented into G3D, such as TriTree's intersectRays methods and surfel's scatter method

Algorithmic:
    - We learned why Monte Carlo algorithms are widely used
    - We learned, in depth, the path tracing algorithm
    - We learned how to do importance sampling on lights

Mathematical:
    - We learned that caustics are caused with a minimum of 4 scattering events
    - We learned about the cool effects light can have on different surfaces
    - We learned to bump rays using 0.0001f and not FLT_EPSILON

Other:
    - We learned how fun it is to make cool pictures

Workflow
================================
Jose: 6 Hour MVP + 10 Hour Polish
John: 5.5 Hour MVP + 10 Hour Polish

A lot of the stuff we did at the end was trying to figure out why some small issues were occuring. Thankfully, we still managed to complete everything with good amount of time to render tests.
