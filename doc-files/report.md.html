![Basic generation example](evocative.png)

This program will procedurally generate distinct species of corral using a Lindernmeyer System (L-system). By specifying the species and specifying a color, we can generate unique corral and anenomes that will look amazing in any underwater environment. Corral and anenomes, like trees, can be represented as a recursive structure made of cylinders that shrink as they go farther from the base. Thus, an L-System can be used to model Corral and anenomes. In order to avoid having an exponential number of polygons as we recurse, we model the L-systems in 2D, generating a bump map for each coral as we do so. Then, we create a billboard for each piece of coral, with a material that has the colored image of the coral as its lambertian and the bump map as the bump.

Specification
============================================================================================

Procedurally generate realistic coral using "Billboard" Texture and Normal Maps. 

1. Scene Generation:
  1. Create different 2D images representing different species of coral with slight variations.
  2. Write a scene file that puts gnerated lambertian and bump on a model in an underwater setting.
  3. Add fish models in the scene to make it look realistic.

2. Code:
  1. Create a class (Rasterizer) that can be used to create 2D images, including desired gradiants. This should be called from App::onInit().
  2. Create a class generates2D coral using L-systems.
  3. Write code to generate interesting scenes using our coral.

3. Correctness Results:
    1. Take a picture coral from an angle with the mesh visible to demonstrate billboards.
    2. For each type of coral, show the lambertian image, the bump image, and a simple shot of the resulting coral.

4. Demonstration Results:
  1. A scene with multiple coral in a fishtank with fish.
  2. Close ups of the same scene, such as a particular fish hiding among some coral.

7. Evocative Result:
  1. Create a beautiful, unique scene that demonstrates the beauty of our creations. Put the coral in the ocean with shadows and fish going around to make it look like a real ocean scene.
  2. Render the image using a path tracer in 1024x720 resolution using 1024 paths and 6 scattering events.

Topic Overview
=====================================================================================
To generate practical coral models, we use: 
- L-system: specifies coral structure; 
- Billboards: to generate "light weight" models; 
- Image generation through adapted **rasterization** techniques.

L-System
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lindenmayer (L) systems are mainly used for generating fractals and realistic modeling of plants. 

An L-system consists of: 
- A set of variables: nonterminals that can be replaced by production rules.
- A set of constants: terminals. Constants are any of the following symbols:!, [, ], +, -.
- A single axiom which is a string composed of some number of variables and constants. The axiom is the initial state of the system. 
- A set of production rules defining the way variables can be replaced with combinations of constants and other variables. A production consists of two strings - the predecessor and the successor. The most interesting L-systems are defined by recursive production rules (i.e. rules that include the replaced variable along with other variable and constant combinations).

This project used L-systems as the base for creating different coral models.

L-systems are used to generate relistic tree models by describing the branching of the tree.

Billboards
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Billboards are shaded 2D images used in 3D graphics. These 2D images are often used to simulate 3D objects at lower rendering costs. 

Since our coral models are entirely created by following an L-system, with different recursion depths and recursive rules it would be impractical to create them entirely out of actual 3D polygons, which would create extensive triangle meshes and be heavy to render. Instead we used Billboards to achive the same effect with low tessalation. 

We generate many 3D-looking 2D images of a given coral, then paste them onto flat cubes (the billboards), and intersect them in their centers at different angles. This generates the illusion of a 3D coral that looks slightly different from different angles, within the wireframe of a few cubes instead of many cylinders. 

![Perpendicular billboards wireframe](2016-10-10_008_4-midterm_r1536_g3d_r875__.jpg width=200px) ![Billboard Coral 1](1.jpg width=200px) ![Billboard coral 2](coral_example.jpg width=200px)

3D-looking 2D images were created out of 2 images: one specifying the color, and the other specifying a bump map. The two images were then respectively assigned to the lambertian and bump parameters of the billboard model within the scene file.

Rasterization (partial)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Used to create Billboard lambertian and bump images. 

Rasterization describes a technique to fill out the pixels of a 2D image according to what is visible in a 3D space. 

We use rasterization's pixel filling techniques to create color and bump map images for our corals according to the L-system. Our algorithm takes a center line from the L-system and sets all image pixels within a thickness from the center line to the given solid color or bump map gradient.

Design
=====================================================================================

App makesd an instance of CoralGenerator which it uses to call writeCoral with 2 given images.  CoralGenerator then generates the coral using one of the generate methods specifying an L-System and writes the results of that generation to the images using an instance of the Rasterizor class' drawThickLine method.  Finally, App saves these two images and displays them as a billboard in our coral custom scene.

As a class Rasterizer, is solely responsible for manipulating inputs and setting image pixels. This choice enabled us to separate the definition of what we draw from the definition of how we draw it, and allowed us to work in different definitions simultaneously. Rasterizer doesn't keep any sate, so indefinitely many images can be drawn by calling the methods of a single instance of the class. Although thick line rasterization can be done linearly, drawThickLine() is quadratic. This drawback in time complexity is compensated by the simplicity and robustness of the quadratic approach, especially considering that we can take great advantage of multithreading for setting image pixels. We generate four separate N x N images of slightly different coral faces, then use mergeQuadrants() to set each to one quadrant of a final 2N x 2N image to be used by our OFF file. Although this can be done directly in our final image, our aproach preserves the robustness of Rasterizer.

We have another class called CoralGenerator which is responsible for the procedural generation of coral through L-Systems.  Making the L-Systems a seperate class allows us to focus just on how we would want to generate coral conceptually without having to worry about how the rest of the code functions.  It has a public writeCoral method called from App which generates different types of coral and writes them two images for color and the bump map.  It uses a series of generate functions that specify different L-Systems that are passed to the applyRules method and allow us to create many different types of coral without much code.  The apply rules method was written such that it is able to create many different types of coral given different sets of rules, which makes the code for generating coral easy to read and add allows us to easily add new types of coral to be generated without changing any of our old code.  CoralGenerator also uses a user defined class Edges which holds information for the start and end point for a line to be drawn on an image along with its depth to allow Rasterizer to draw the line and correctly shade it when it is drawn.

CoralSceneGenerator is responsible for generating our two scenes. It does not generate perfect scenes, but places objects approximately in the correct area, allowing for easier manipulation of the scene. The focus was to allow us to create our own custom scenes without having to manually write the entire scene ourselves. The two methods, writeSeaScene and writeTankScene are the two entry points for the program, and they fill in the appropriate information for each scene through their respective helper functions, writeTankEntities and writeSeaEntities. They both share the same models, though they do not necessarily employ all of them. This makes the code simpler, and it allows for better manual editting, since we have all of the models available in either scene. Furthermore, if we need to create more scenes, we can easily copy and paste code around, or change certain specifications for the scenes. Finally, all of this allows for a bit of randomness, which allows for more creative scenes.

We also include a Path Tracer in our project developed by John, Jose, and Julia that allows us to render nice images of the custom scenes we create that we use to show off our coral.

Results
=====================================================================================
The following are the results of our procedural generation. We first demonstrate that the coral we create is visually accurate. Each coral should look as realistic as possible using the "billboard" method. We then show our coral in various different scenes, including with modeled fish floating around them.
